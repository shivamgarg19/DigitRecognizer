# Digit Recognizer
## Overview
This is an android application which can recoginize digit from images of handwritten digit taken from phone camera.

Inorder to recognize hand written digits, deep learning model was trained. I used tensorflow's offical MNIST model and MNIST data set to train the Model.

To use the MNIST trained model in android device, i convert it into tensorflow lite model(which is optimized for android mobile devices)
